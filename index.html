                    <p>One of the first books that I read in <strong>this course was</strong> the story written by Aviaq Johnson “Those Who Run in the Sky.”
                    This was the book that created the depiction of the image above that you initially saw. This book taught me a lot about
                    reverence and how Inuit culture specifically behaves and uses stories to deepen their connections and love. It brought
                    together really highlighted moments of how Indigenous stories have lots of deeper meaning and connections and how not
                    everything is as black and white. It was one of the stories that I read and actually thought was impressive because it
                    showed how Indigenous authors can use storytelling to create actual heartfelt books that people may enjoy reading
                    further, which changed my perspective on how I viewed Indigenous stories and authors! Aside from reverence, I learnt
                    interconnectedness and how everything is all connected to the land, water, and amazing mother nature. I learnt how
                    resilience is brought in and how it's highly valued among Indigenous communities, especially that of the Inuit culture!
                    The book also touched base on clear instances of assimilation done through references that geared indirectly towards
                    European colonization! Growing up in a predominantly settler community, Indigenous stories and perspectives were rarely part of my life
                    experience until taking Contemporary Aboriginal Voices this semester. Through analyzing Aviaq Johnston's profoundly
                    moving novel Those Who Run in the Sky, I gained crucial insights into Inuit epistemologies and came to a deeper
                    understanding of my own role and responsibilities.</p>

                    <br/>

                    <>I was struck by how Johnston's vivid depictions of Inuit spirituality allowed readers to experience ancestral wisdoms
                    from the inside out. By following Pitu's journey of personal growth through facing relentless hardship, I gleaned
                    profound life lessons about resilience, gratitude, and embracing communal responsibilities. Pitu's maturation from a
                    disrespectful youth to a young man of profound reverence holds valuable mirrors for self-reflection. Though his beloved
                    Saima married another, Pitu embodied ancestral teachings by respecting their union rather than indulging in jealousy—a
                    lesson not lost on me regarding respecting relationships. Discussing these insights with my parents and friends revealed gaps in our collective knowledge about Indigenous
                    realities. I realized how easy it can be to drift through life ignorant of oppression's intergenerational impacts right
                    here in our own backyards. This course lit a fire within me to embrace “Reconcili-ACTION” through learning more about
                    our territory's original stewardship nations, championing Indigenous leadership, advocating for clean water, and
                    demanding land back. Going forward, I vow to cultivate reverence by embracing humility, engaging local knowledge keepers
                    respectfully, and embodying responsibilities as a newcomer through concrete allyship and environmental stewardship.</p>

                    <br/>

                    <p>In conclusion, this book made me understand the true value of life and the basic necessities that we take for granted.
                    It also made me open my vision on Indigenous assimilation and historical issues. Previously, I was blinded-sighted and
                    annoyed by the constant talk of it, but now I deeply reflected and even used some of the books' lessons as inspiration
                    to my own learning. I shared many of these stories with my online friends but also my family, showcasing to them how
                    lucky we are not to have to deal with the extremely hard hardships others might have to go through!</p>

                <div class="intro-paragraph-text">
                    <p>Aviaq Johnston's captivating short story “The Haunted Blizzard” illuminated profound lessons about embracing ancestral
                    wisdom and respecting the vulnerabilities of others. Following Panik’s harrowing experience during an ominous storm, I
                    reflected deeply on my responsibilities as an outsider resident on these lands. Johnston skillfully conveyed the rich
                    cultural knowledge held within Indigenous storytelling through Nita’s grandmother’s ominous warnings. Her dire pleas to
                    “stay with us” and avoid isolation reflected a sincere duty to protect youth, exemplifying reverence for community.
                    However, Panik’s mother expressed skepticism, symbolizing eroding respect for ancestral guidance. This juxtaposition
                    underscores intergenerational divides in comprehending local realities.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Witnessing Panik’s sheer terror confronting manifestations of folklore highlighted empathy’s importance. Where adults
                    dismiss “imagination,” children grasp multidimensional truths, as their minds remain open. Elders pass down intangible
                    wisdoms ensuring resilience through adversity. Though uncertainty cloaked descriptions, spiritual teachings centered
                    relational duties, prioritizing safety above individualism. This left a profound impression on cultivating care through
                    uncertainty. Moving forward, I vow to follow Panik’s transforming outlook. Where skepticism once clouded my perspective,
                    embracing humility means engaging Indigenous knowledge respectfully. Locally, this involves attentively listening to
                    knowledge keepers about responsibilities regarding natural sites, seeking permission before accessing territories, and
                    championing language/tradition revitalization.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>On a broader scale, it means recognizing oppression’s lasting impacts through generational trauma and advocating for
                    clean waters, language laws, and missing persons inquiries. As an ally, I aim to integrate ancestral teachings
                    respecting all relations into daily lives through plant-based diets, shifting industrial paradigms threatening Mother
                    Earth, whose health sustains all equally. It further means looking not just at Indigenous cultures but society as a
                    whole and realizing when I am being pressured or when I am not, or when my gut delivers that feeling of “stop” or when
                    it doesn’t and so on and so forth. It also means seeing how life and my environment subconsciously affects me, and
                    reflecting on that to improve my own personal skills and influence myself for the better Most importantly, it means
                    cultivating profound reverence within relationships by acknowledging vulnerabilities, acknowledging one’s positionality,
                    and strengthening community ties. Though challenges persist, focusing on interconnectivity between all peoples provides
                    solace. This story powerfully illuminated pathways towards walking respectfully on these lands through reverence,
                    resilience and relational duties.</p>

                    <p>The Grizzlies conveyed profound and impactful lessons about cultivating reverence that will guide my own journey of
                    ReconciliACTION. Most prominently, I was struck by the transformative power of reconnecting youth to lost cultural roots
                    through the lacrosse team. In those powerful redemption arcs, I witnessed how embracing ancestral teachings and
                    traditions can lift spirits and redirect struggles towards achievement. Russ Shepherd's journey also left a deep
                    impression. I was troubled by his initial dismissiveness but heartened by his evolution into a revered ally through
                    listening, apologizing and championing students sincerely. This reinforced that cultivating reverence is an ongoing
                    process requiring humility, compassion and championing others. It reinforced my commitment to approaching all
                    relationships, whether face-to-face or online, with respect by acknowledging expertise, avoiding assumptions and
                    prioritizing dignity.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>This taught me the importance of strengthening communal bonds by celebrating cultural resurgence wherever possible
                    through supporting Indigenous arts, business initiatives and language revitalization. On a personal level, it inspired
                    me to further my own understanding by engaging local knowledge keepers to learn welcoming protocols and responsibilities
                    as a newcomer on these lands. I want to foster reverence through embracing teachings that uplift rather than dismiss
                    Indigenous sovereignty and identities. It also taught me not to see everything as black and white, i.e not to judge a
                    book by its cover or in this case a community. On a more broader scale, I can use this to assist people who are going
                    through tougher times by using a sport like lacrosse to help them out.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In the future once I am older and have the allocated funds I can attempt to develop an interactive workshop/presentation
                    for students/community groups highlighting key lessons from The Grizzlies and other authors and inviting discussion on
                    developing cultural competence and embracing an ethos of reverence. Provide recommended resources for further learning.
                    Overall, The Grizzlies underscored that true ReconciliACTION springs from within - through embracing responsibilities,
                    acknowledging hardships without skepticism and nurturing communal wellness above individualism. It is a daily practice
                    of learning, growing in humility and centering relationships rooted in care, empathy and reverence for shared humanity
                    above perceived differences. I vow to walk this path through kindness, compassion and striving to honor all peoples.</p>

                    <p>The literature circles provided a meaningful platform to cultivate profound reverence through authentic sharing and
                    listening across diverse experiences. Being able to discuss impactful works like The Grizzlies, Those Who Run in the Sky
                    and The Haunted Blizzard with peers unveiled deeper layers of wisdom I may have otherwise overlooked. Hearing different
                    analyses enriched my perspective by acknowledging subjective truths. Discussing tensions like Pitu’s journey prompted
                    critical self-reflection on my own blindspots and assumptions. Thought-provoking questions from others challenged
                    preconceived notions and broadened understanding systemic oppression's intricate roots.By synthesizing takeaways, I
                    gained nuanced insights into historical and contemporary impediments to wellness, like love and respect, or lack of
                    sovereignty and cultural erasure. Accounting for sociopolitical contexts augmented personal connections to rich
                    characters and storylines. This scaffolding supported comprehending multi-faceted hardship sensitively from an
                    Indigenous lens.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Perhaps most impactfully, literature circles cultivated reverence on an interpersonal level. Witnessing resilience among
                    struggling communities through others’ eyes motivated responsibility as an ally. These meaningful exchanges lit a fire within me to
                    continuously challenge biases, embrace cultural consultations, research challenges respectfully and support grassroots
                    organizations centered on indigenous visions of well-being. They empowered moving reconciliation from an theoretical
                    concept into meaningful daily practice through relationship-centered living.</p>

    <p>
My vision for this artifact was to create an engaging resource that would foster deeper understanding of Indigenous
knowledge and lived experiences among learner audiences. Through multimedia storytelling and highlighting transformative
themes, I hoped to inspire profound reflection on responsibilities as newcomers to these territories. It was important
for me to authentically honor ancestral wisdoms while ensuring a respectful and accessible experience. I want
individuals to come away feeling motivated to embrace reconciliation through cultivating empathy, championing
sovereignty, building compassionate relations and championing wellness through small thoughtful actions.
    </p> 

    <br/>
    <p>
        In constructing this site, I carefully considered prominent lessons from course works like those symbolized through
        characters' journeys towards reverence in The Grizzlies film and Johnston's novels. I included location profiles,
        cultural videos, interactive activities and advocacy resources to holistically demonstrate reconciliation principles in
        an interactive manner. The clean aesthetic aimed to prioritize messaging while subtly conveying responsibility. Drawing
        from literature circle discussions, I incorporated diverse understandings around developing care through facing
        hardship, reconnecting culture and traditions, acknowledging oppression's impacts and nurturing communal belonging
        across differing perspectives. My goal was an experiential learning tool synthesizing how each individual truly embraces
        responsibilities as newcomers through relationship-centered living.
